    <p>The Forks of the Credit Provincial Park is located in the heart of the credit valley. This compact park is a haven for hikers with several trails featuring various terrains ranging from rolling fields to rocky dirt paths. I recently had the pleasure of taking to the trails on a bright Sunday morning. We arrived at the park at 10am. The weather was perfect not a cloud in sight. We started at the Meadow Trail which leads to the famed Cataract Falls and a platform lookout point. The hike starts with the dirt path taking you though various rolling fields.</p>
